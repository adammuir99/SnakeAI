## High-Level
The purpose of this project was to create an AI that would teach itself how to play the popular game Snake (Click [Here](https://github.com/adammuir99/SnakeGame) to see how the game itself was made). Feed-forward neural networks were used as the artifical 'brain' for each snake to determine which direction to move next. For the overall population, a Genetic Algorithm was used to implement evolution and promote genetic diversity.
